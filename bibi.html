            <h3>Group Formation</h3>
            <p>In the anime, the unit was formed by drawing lots.</p>
            <p>In real life, the unit was formed in phases:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>March 2011, the three unit leaders, Honoka Kosaka, Umi Sonoda and Eli Ayase were revealed with this key visual. People were then given five sets of possible unit compositions, and asked to vote for which members should belong in each leader's sub-unit.</li>
                <li>April 2011, the new unit compositions were revealed, and people were asked to submit names for them</li>
                <li>May 2011, the chosen unit names were revealed.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            <p>Due to the image presented by the members, many of the name submissions to the staff had an adult and graceful feel to them. BiBi's name was meant to symbolize the sharp style and fashion exhibited by members of the group. Other highlighted submissions included "Grace Maiden" and "Shiny Silhouette."</p>
