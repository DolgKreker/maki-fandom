            <p>Maki Nishikino is one of the nine main characters in Love Live!. She is a first year at Otonokizaka High School. Her image color is red. She is a member of BiBi, a sub-unit under μ's. She is also the vice-president of the Idol Research Club and the end of the movie, she was succeeded by Yukiho Kosaka and Alisa Ayase.</p>
            <p>Maki comes from a wealthy family of doctors, and is somewhat pressured to become a doctor, like her parents, which would lead her into giving up music, which causes her to refuse to join µ's at first.</p>
            <p>Because of Maki's wealth, it is discovered in Season 1 Episode 10 that her parents own a beach house. Therefore, μ's gladly insisted that Maki should go and ask her parents if they could use it, which they allow. In Season 2 Episode 2, it is revealed that her family also owns a vacation house in the mountains.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Maki has the qualities of a tsundere, and she has a hard time admitting her true feelings to her peers. She also has somewhat childish beliefs, as demonstrated by the group finding out that she still believes in Santa Claus.<br>
            Maki is also quite stubborn. This was shown when she was invited to play at the beach, as she was withdrawn from the group and not interested in playing with them.<br>
            Maki was initially portrayed as a loner in the first few episodes, and spent her time alone in the music room.<br>
            Her personality often clashes with Nico Yazawa, such as when she called Nico stubborn during Season 2 Episode 4. Rin, however, tells her "You're one to talk", implying that Maki is stubborn as well.</p>
